I'm a PhD student on the [Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI programme](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/). I'm currently setting out the direction of my research; I hope to find competitive approaches to aligning machine learning programs with human preferences (with the help of new transparency tools). I am motivated by the [arguments for trying to positively impact the long-run future](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/Greaves_MacAskill_The_Case_for_Strong_Longtermism.pdf), and believe that developing [provably beneficial AI](https://youtu.be/pARXQnX6QS8) is a pressing area of research for protecting the future of humanity.

I was part of the first cohort on the Natural Sciences course at the University of York, a programme spearheaded by Roddy Vann that tackles interdisciplinary science education incredibly effectively. I studied chemistry, mathematics, and physics here - spending most of my time with computational physics by the end of my degree.

I'm involved with the [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) community, and have spent several years organising events and discussions for [York's EA group](https://eahub.org/group/effective-altruism-york/).
