I understand that indexing from zero seems perfectly appropriate for many
people, but this is not a statement in support of that. Instead, this is simply
a placeholder while I customise this site (and consider writing things -
  perhaps).

## Planned changes
- Enable a theme that has links to subheadings
- Introduce Tufte-CSS for sidenotes
- Write things
- Wiki link enabler (digital garden jeykll template)
- Use EB Garamond
- Add a nice gradient to my top banner
