I understand that indexing from zero seems perfectly appropriate for many
people, but this is not a statement in support of that. Instead, this is simply
a placeholder while I customise this site (and consider writing things -
  perhaps).

## Planned changes
- Enable a theme (a customised version of Leap Day) that has links to
 subheadings.
- Introduce Tufte-CSS for sidenotes
- Write things (seaweed!)
- Wiki link enabler (digital garden jeykll template)
- Use EB Garamond
- Add a nice gradient to my top banner
- Redirect to my domain name
