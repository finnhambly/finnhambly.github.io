Hi, this is my personal blog site. Feel free to use the source code, but it's basically just 
[the Franklin.jl Tufte template](https://github.com/tlienart/FranklinTemplates.jl), centred, and with the Source Serif Pro font.

I also used [Abhinav Kaushlya's function for listing blogposts](https://github.com/abhishalya/abhishalya.github.io), with minor formatting changes.
