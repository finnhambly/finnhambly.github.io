Hi, I'm Finn ðŸ‘‹

This website is only a couple of months old at the moment, but topics I currently have blog-worthy notes on include:
- concepts to help you balance inside and outside views when forecasting,
- how expected value reasoning goes wrong when making decisions concerning the longterm future, and
- notions of 'utility' that aren't naturally associated with utilitarianism.
