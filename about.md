# About

Hi, I'm Finn ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a PhD student on the Accountable, Responsible, Transparent AI programme at the University of Bath. I'm currently making probabilistic models of the UKâ€™s electricity distribution networks and the electrification of domestic heating.

I'm also quite into forecasting, decision making under uncertainty, and effective altruism. I do my forecasting under a pseudonym, which isn't the best for either public accountability or signalling, but I found I was more willing to update regularly, and worry less about sharing rationale that were bound to age poorly.

I mostly stopped posting on Twitter when I started my PhD in 2020 (other things also happened that year), but I'll end my hiatus at some point soon:  [@finnhambly](https://twitter.com/finnhambly).
