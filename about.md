Hi, I'm Finn ðŸ‘‹

This website is only a couple of months old at the moment, but topics I currently have blog-worthy notes on include:
- mathematical concepts to help you balance inside and outside views when forecasting,
- the moral implications of the simulation hypothesis,
- Norbert Wiener's articulation of information hazards,
- how expected value reasoning goes wrong when making decisions concerning the longterm future,
- notions of 'utility' that aren't naturally associated with utilitarianism, and
- vague political economy concepts I'd like to dive into.

If you would like to contact me, you can DM me on Twitter, [@finnhambly](https://twitter.com/finnhambly), or email [my name] at gmail.com.
