# About

Hi, I'm Finn ðŸ‘‹

I've just started a small research org and am making tools that can aggregate forecasters' probabilistic models. My primary goal is to figure out feasible [differential technological development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_technological_development) strategies (by dealing with our multiple sources of uncertainties properly).

Before that, I was doing a CS/electrical engineering PhD (though was mostly learning about statistics and economics). Before *that*, I studied Natural Sciences (specialising in Physics) at York, with a small intermission for building a medical device. My current interests are mostly a result of all of that, with most of my aspirational ideas involving the Julia programming language, scientific simulations, creating new kinds of sensors, amateur political economy stuff, and digital interactivity.

I also do some professional forecasting; I'm currently having a lot of fun forecasting and writing for the [Swift Centre](https://www.swiftcentre.org/).

Writing on this blog is mostly a clarity-gaining exercise for myself, rather than broadcasting my "takes" on existing discourse. Topics I currently have blog-worthy notes on include:
- concepts to help you balance inside and outside views when forecasting,
- how expected value reasoning goes wrong when making decisions concerning the longterm future, and
- notions of 'utility' that aren't naturally associated with utilitarianism.

If you would like to contact me you can DM me on Twitter, [@finnhambly](https://twitter.com/finnhambly) or email [my name] at gmail.com. You can also give me feedback below (I'd be grateful to hear any gripes you have with me or what I've written).
