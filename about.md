# About

Hi, I'm Finn ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a PhD student on the Accountable, Responsible, Transparent AI programme at the University of Bath. I'm currently making probabilistic models of the UKâ€™s electricity distribution networks and the electrification of domestic heating.

I'm also quite into forecasting, decision making under uncertainty, and effective altruism. I don't know how much more you need to know about me; I'll add more information at some point soon, perhaps. If you would like to contact me, you can DM me on Twitter or email [my name] at gmail.com.

Here's my Twitter: [@finnhambly](https://twitter.com/finnhambly).
