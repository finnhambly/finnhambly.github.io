Hi, I'm Finn ðŸ‘‹

This website is only a couple of months old at the moment, but topics I currently have blog-worthy notes on include:
- concepts to help you balance inside and outside views when forecasting,
- how expected value reasoning goes wrong when making decisions concerning the longterm future, and
- notions of 'utility' that aren't naturally associated with utilitarianism.

If you would like to contact me, you can DM me on Twitter, [@finnhambly](https://twitter.com/finnhambly), or email [my name] at gmail.com. You can also give me feedback below.
