## What I get up to

I've just started a small research org and am making tools that can aggregate forecasters' probabilistic models. My primary goal is to figure out feasible [differential technological development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_technological_development) strategies (by dealing with our multiple sources of uncertainties properly).

Before that, I was doing a CS/electrical engineering PhD (though was mostly learning about statistics and economics). Before *that*, I studied Natural Sciences (specialising in Physics) at York, with a small intermission for building a medical device. My current interests are mostly a result of all of that, with most of my aspirational ideas involving the Julia programming language, scientific simulations, creating new kinds of sensors, amateur political economy thinking, and digital interactivity.

I also do some professional forecasting for [INFER-public](https://www.infer-pub.com/) and the [Swift Centre](https://www.swiftcentre.org/).
